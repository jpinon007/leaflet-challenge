# leaflet-challenge

# Background: Th USGS is responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, ecosystem and environmental health, and impacts of climate and land-use change. The USGS wants to build a new set of tools that will allow them to visualize their earthquake data. In this challenge, I was tasked to develop a way to visualize USGS data to better educate the public and government organizations on issues facing the planet. 

# Solution: To complete this assignment, I worked with my tutor Fred where he was able to share and correct my code using pastebin. 

# Part 1: Visualize an earthquake dataset using the USGS GeoJSON Feed, https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php . I used the URL of the JSON to pull data for the visualization. To import and visualize the data, I used Leaflet to create a map that plots all the earthquakes from the dataset based on their longitude and latitude. Included are popups that provide additional information about the earthquake when its respective marker is clicked. 

# Part 2: A second dataset was plotted on the map to illustrate the relationship between tectonic plates and seismic activity. Each dataset was pladced in separate overlays as well as layer controls on the map.
